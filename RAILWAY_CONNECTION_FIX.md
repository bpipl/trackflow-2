# Railway Networking Fix for Track Flow Courier

Based on the Railway dashboard screenshot and logs, we've identified that while both the PostgreSQL database and application are deployed and running correctly individually, they aren't properly linked. This explains why we're seeing "Application failed to respond" despite the server successfully starting.

## The Issue

In Railway's architecture, services need explicit connections configured to communicate with each other. Looking at your dashboard:

1. The PostgreSQL database is running (green checkmark)
2. Your application (trackflow-2) is deploying from GitHub 
3. **But there's no connection line between them in the UI**

This means your application can't access the database, even though both are running.

## How to Fix

### Method 1: Using Railway Dashboard UI

1. In the Railway dashboard, click on your application deployment (trackflow-2)
2. Go to the "Variables" tab
3. Add a reference to the PostgreSQL service's DATABASE_URL:
   - Click "Add" or "New Variable"
   - Enter "DATABASE_URL" as the name
   - For the value, select "Reference another variable"
   - Choose your PostgreSQL service and select its DATABASE_URL 
   - This will create a connection between services

### Method 2: Using Railway CLI

1. Install Railway CLI if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://railway.app/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. Link to your project:
   ```bash
   railway link -p 9f8ad38f-5de4-4d1c-bf79-4dd97985a270
   ```

3. List your project services:
   ```bash
   railway service list
   ```

4. Connect PostgreSQL to your app (replace SERVICE_ID with your app's service ID):
   ```bash
   railway variables set DATABASE_URL="$POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING" --service SERVICE_ID
   ```

## Verifying the Connection

After making this change:

1. You should see a visible connection line between the PostgreSQL database and your application in the Railway dashboard
2. Your app should redeploy automatically
3. The logs should show successful database connections
4. The application should start responding properly

This networking configuration is a common oversight in Railway deployments, as the platform requires explicit service connections for security and isolation purposes.
