# Track Flow Courier - Railway Deployment Fixes

This document summarizes the issues encountered during Railway deployment and the fixes applied.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Database Migration Issues
- **Fixed SQL syntax errors** in the permissions setup
- Replaced PL/pgSQL block with direct INSERT statements for permissions
- Database migrations now complete successfully (verified in logs)

### 2. Authentication Middleware Issues
- **Fixed import pattern** in route handlers
- Changed from `const { authenticate } = require('./auth')` to explicit import
- Affects WhatsApp settings and templates routes

### 3. Enhanced Debugging Capabilities
- Added comprehensive debugging system with detailed logging
- Improved database connection with retry logic
- Added enhanced health check endpoints
- Setup global error handling

## Current Status

From the deployment logs, we now see:
- ✅ Database migrations complete successfully
- ✅ Tables are created properly (11 tables reported)
- ✅ Server starts on port 10000 in production mode

However, the application still shows a 502 Bad Gateway error.

## Accessing Diagnostic Information

We've added special diagnostic endpoints that can be accessed directly:

- `/deploy-check` - View basic server and frontend status
- `/deploy-check/check-static` - Check if static files exist
- `/health` - Simple health check with system info
- `/health/diagnostics` - Detailed system diagnostics

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Missing Frontend Build

If you see "❌ Directory Exists: No - Build may be missing" on the `/deploy-check` page, then:

```bash
# Build the frontend and push to Railway
npm run build
git add dist
git commit -m "Add production build"
git push
```

### Network/Port Configuration

Ensure Railway is configured to use the correct port:

1. Check `PORT` environment variable in Railway dashboard
2. Verify the Procfile contains: `web: node server/index.js`

### SSL/HTTPS Issues

If you're having SSL issues:

1. Set `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` temporarily to debug (not recommended for production)
2. Check Railway's documentation for SSL configuration

## Using Railway CLI for Debugging

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
curl -fsSL https://railway.app/install.sh | sh

# Link to your project
railway link -p 9f8ad38f-5de4-4d1c-bf79-4dd97985a270

# View logs
railway logs

# Connect to your database
railway connect
```

## Next Steps for Troubleshooting

1. Check `/deploy-check` endpoint to verify if static files are present
2. Review Railway logs for any errors after server startup
3. Try running the application locally with `NODE_ENV=production` to simulate the production environment
4. If the issue persists, consider reaching out to Railway support
