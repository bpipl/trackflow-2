# Track Flow Courier - Railway Deployment Fixes

## Summary of Changes

We've addressed several issues to ensure the application boots properly on Railway with database connectivity:

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Set `NODE_ENV=production` in .env file to enable proper SSL configuration for PostgreSQL
   - Verified DATABASE_URL and JWT_SECRET are properly set

2. **Database Schema Updates**
   - Added missing tables for essential features:
     - `whatsapp_settings` for WhatsApp notification configuration
     - `templates` for courier slip template storage
     - `reports` for saved report configurations

3. **Server Configuration**
   - Modified server startup to run migrations before launching the application in production
   - Added connection retry logic to handle database startup timing issues
   - Enhanced error handling for migration failures

4. **API Additions**
   - Created API routes for WhatsApp settings (`/api/whatsapp-settings`)
   - Created API routes for Templates (`/api/templates`)
   - Updated API client to support the new endpoints

5. **Frontend Context Updates**
   - Updated WhatsAppSettingsContext to use database storage instead of localStorage
   - Updated TemplateContext to use database storage instead of localStorage

## Deployment Verification

The deployment check script verifies:
- All required environment variables are set
- All required files are present
- Database schema includes all required tables
- Database connection works correctly

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Table Initialization**
   - On first boot, the app will create the missing tables automatically
   - WhatsApp settings and templates will be populated with defaults

2. **Monitoring**
   - Monitor the application logs on Railway for any errors
   - Use the health endpoint (`/health`) to verify app status

3. **Testing**
   - Verify WhatsApp settings functionality
   - Test template editor and make sure templates are saved to the database
   - Ensure all previous functionality continues to work with real database
